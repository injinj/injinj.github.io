title: Quanta LB8 with Almach
---

I have acquired a strange piece of history: A Quanta LB8 switch loaded with an
early version of the Cumulus NOS customized and deployed at Amazon. The LB8 is
a 48 port 10gbe switch based on the <a

BCM56840</a> platform. This is the login screen I am greeted with when I shell
into it.
