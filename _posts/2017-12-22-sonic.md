title: Sonic on Arista 7050qx-32
---

I finally got to spend some quality time with my Arista 7050QX-32 and Azure
SONiC.  SONiC, an open source network operating system sponsered by Microsoft.
Out of the box without any configuration whatsoever, has BGP running on all of
the interfaces. This is intended to allow Layer 3 native IP networking for each
of the hosts and their containers, significantly simplifying networking without
the typical Layer 2 container networking overlays.  After installing and
configuring my hosts for BGP, I can get TCP performance at line rate between
containers on different hosts without tuning much (although the MTU is 9000 and
that helps a lot).
